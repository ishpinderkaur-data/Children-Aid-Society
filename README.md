# Children-Aid-Society
This project investigates racial disproportionality in child protection investigations using data from the **Children’s Aid Society (CAS) of Toronto** and population data from the **Toronto Wellbeing Index**.  Due to data confidentiality, raw datasets cannot be shared. However, key findings, methods, and dashboard screenshots are presented here.

Project Goals

- Examine whether specific racial groups are overrepresented in child welfare cases
- Compare CAS investigation rates with Toronto’s population demographics
- Apply statistical testing (Z-test for proportions) to confirm disproportionality
- Use visual analytics to identify patterns and support equity-focused decisions

Tools & Techniques

- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data cleaning, joining, filtering
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for visualization
- **Z-test for proportions** – To test for statistically significant overrepresentation
- **Excel** – Used alongside Power BI for data preprocessing
- **Normalization** – Ensured data was consistent and relational

   Dashboard Snapshots
  -All dashboard screenshots are available in the folder named `Visulaizations`.
  These include:
- Case volume by race and postal region
- Case reasons (categorized by ES codes)
- Gaps between population share and investigation share
- Geographical distribution of CAS cases
- Socioeconomic overlays (unemployment, income)

  Key Insights

- **Black children** were found to be significantly overrepresented in many Toronto neighborhoods.
- **Z-test results** confirmed the disproportionality was statistically significant.
- **Low-population regions** sometimes had disproportionately high case volumes, suggesting potential targeted over-surveillance.
- The dashboard visualizations make it easier for policymakers and social workers to identify systemic issues and better allocate resources.

  What I Learned

- How to use data to explore **social justice issues**
- Real-world application of **hypothesis testing** (Z-test) to validate data-driven claims
- Designed clear, insightful dashboards for **effective data storytelling**
- Gained experience in handling **confidential and sensitive data** responsibly
