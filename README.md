# Children-Aid-Society
This project investigates racial disproportionality in child protection investigations using data from the **Children’s Aid Society (CAS) of Toronto** and population data from the **Toronto Wellbeing Index**.  Due to data confidentiality, raw datasets cannot be shared. However, key findings, methods, and dashboard screenshots are presented here.

Project Goals
- Examine if specific racial groups are overrepresented in child welfare cases
- Compare investigation rates with Toronto’s population demographics
- Use statistical testing and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends
- Provide insights to help improve fairness in service delivery

Tools & Techniques

- **SQL (MySQL)** – Data cleaning, joining, filtering
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for visualization
- **Z-test for proportions** – To test for statistically significant overrepresentation
- **Excel** – Used alongside Power BI for data preprocessing
- **Normalization** – Ensured data was consistent and relational

   Dashboard Snapshots
  -These can be found in the file named dashoard.

  Key Insights

- Black children were found to be **overrepresented** in several Toronto neighborhoods.
- Z-test confirmed that the differences in case involvement were statistically significant.
- Some low-population areas had high case volumes, indicating targeted over-surveillance.
- The dashboard makes it easier for policymakers to spot trends and allocate resources better.

  What I Learned

- How to use data to explore **social justice issues**
- Real-world application of **hypothesis testing** (Z-test)
- Designing dashboards for **clear storytelling**
- Handling **confidential data** responsibly
